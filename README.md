# InventoryManagement

In order to run this project, simply run the InventoryManager.py file i.e. python InventoryManager.py

The initial order quantities for each product type is as follows :
A : 150
B: 150
C: 100
D: 100
E:200

A datasource class randomly generates an order line 300 times(number chosen so that datasource gets exhausted and data gets printed)
Each order line contains orders for each product type with quantity randomly ranging from 0-7 where 0,6,7 are invalid orders and won't get processed
